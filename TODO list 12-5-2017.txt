Questions for joel:
How to use listviews how I want (Click on a value in listview, get out an Item)
How to consolidate controllers/fxml's
is the ui acceptable?
is there a rubric?
How in our design would we close connections on displayclose?


General things to add:
Timers on items 
Implementing ITEM_SOLD msg
Gracefully shutting down Clients, SHUT_DOWN message
Messaging for when an agent was passed by in a bid


Things to add(Anthony):
UI should display what user currently has on hold.
UI should display what a user has already bought.
display the status of items (regardless of whether they bid on them or not)
status of items they have bid on
clean up the bankconnected/acconnected booleans (perhaps we can connect to another ip later on)

DESIGN:
ac/ah/bank controller/fxml are way, way similar, fix this
Catch bad output in the textfields


BUGS:
Check for interleaving messages. I don't think I'm checking anywhere for this.
