1. First, you want to spin up a Bank and AuctionCentral.
I prefer toput these both on the same command line using &

Go into /out/production/PublicAuction
java Server Bank &
java Server AC &

2. Now, if you want an AuctionHouse I recommend opening another shell
java Client AH AH1

3. Now, if you want an Agent, I personally recommend using the GUI but
    you can use an agent on the shell also.
    
java Client Agent Agent1

OR

run Main(), this will give you a popup with an option to enter an amount to
withdraw from the Bank. It is currently hard-coded in the bank to withdraw 100.00
regardless of what you enter. This is what we need the messaging infrastructure for.
