User's guide 12/1/2017 (For a pure console implementation, this is very limited)

1. First, you want to spin up a Bank and AuctionCentral.
    I prefer to put these both on the same command line using &

    Go into /out/production/PublicAuction (Or where ever your .class' are)
    
    Run:
    java Server Bank &
    java Server AC &

2. Now, if you want an AuctionHouse I recommend opening another shell
    
    Run:
    java Client AH AH1  (Note: AH1 designates a name, give it anything)

3. Now, if you want an Agent, I personally recommend using the GUI but
    you can use an agent on the shell also.
    
    Run:
    java Client Agent Agent1 (Note: Agent1 designates a name, give it anything)

    Keep in mind the Agent is very limited on the command line and was originally
    made strictly for debug'ing. This is still left in for "proof of concept".
    A proper Agent would be spun up from the Main GUI
