1.) Run Main(), select Bank
2.) Run Main(), select Auction Central
^^ These two NEED to be ran before spinning up AH's or Agent's.
This is an assumption of this entire project that Bank/AC are always up.


3.) Run Main(), select Auction House
4.) Run Main(), select Agent
    Agent will give you various abilities to look at items, do a withdrawl,
    place a bid, etc.
    
    
Feel free to do #3 and #4 in whatever order you'd like and as often as you'd like.
The program is designed to have as many Agent's and AHs as you want.
